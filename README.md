📦 How to Use---

  1. Clone the Repository

     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-app.git
     cd todo-list-app

  2. Open in Browser
     
     Open index.html in your preferred browser.

     * Enter a task in the input field.
     * Click Add to add the task.
     * Use the pencil icon to edit a task, then click Update.
     * Click the trash icon to delete a task.

🧠 Logic Breakdown---

  * Tasks are stored in an array and rendered dynamically.
  * Adding a task inserts it at the top of the list.
  * Editing populates the input with the selected task text and switches the button to “Update”.
  * Deleting removes the task from the array and updates the list.
  * The app handles index shifts when tasks are edited or deleted.

🧪 Validation---

  * Ensures no empty task can be added.
  * Prevents errors during edit and delete operations.
